# Read the following Instructions
Tasks are available in HTML, C#, Python languages. You can choose any language and patch any amount of bugs. But the minimum is 1 patch per repository. Which means you have to patch at least one bug for all 4 repositories (4 tasks).

The Task-1, Task-2, Task-3, Task-4 files have some bugs to be patched. Tasks are in 4 different repositories (Check below links).

1. Fork the repository
2. Find a bug (Enlosed within `<!-- Bug Start #000 -->` and `<!-- Bug End -->` OR `/* Bug Start #000 */` and `/* Bug End */` OR `# Bug Start #000` and `# Bug End`)
3. Patch/Correct the bug (Do not remove `<!-- Bug Start #000 -->` and `<!-- Bug End -->` OR `/* Bug Start #000 */` and `/* Bug End */` OR `# Bug Start #000` and `# Bug End`)
4. Make a pull request (Include the Bug ID you're patching in request title Ex: `Patch for #000`)

# Important
* Remember: 1 pull request = 1 bug
* You have ONLY to send 4 pull requests. Which means 4 bugs. (1 bug per 1 pull request AND 1 pull request from 1 file)
* Use 1 task file for 1 pull request

Ex: 

* First pull request from [Task-1](https://github.com/edviconedu/Hacktoberfest2021-Task1)

* Second pull request from [Task-2](https://github.com/edviconedu/Hacktoberfest2021-Task2)

* Third pull request from [Task-3](https://github.com/edviconedu/Hacktoberfest2021-Task3)

* Fourth pull request from [Task-4](https://github.com/edviconedu/Hacktoberfest2021-Task4)


# Files you're can choose to patch per Task

* HTML - (10 bugs in each task repository)

* CSS - (5 bugs in each task repository)

* JavaScript - (8 bugs in each task repository)


## Keep in mind - You cannot fix same bug in each task.

Ex: If you patch the bug `#001` of Task-1, you're not allowed to patch the same bug `#001` of the Task-2 or Task-3 or Task-4. Doing so will disqualify you from the competition.
